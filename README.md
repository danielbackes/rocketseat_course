# Rocketseat Courses

This project aim to group the code maked by the course instructor, that I copied to practice and memorize the concepts.
Another aim of this project is group the challenge projects proposol by instructor and that I developed to put
in pratice the concepts that I just learn.

There are another projects that I developed durant the course, however, for being biggest projects I decided that is
better create an isolated project for each one, that also are available on github.

Using the Feynman Technique to improve my learning about the course content and improve my English learning.
